ABSTRACT 
Crowd behavior analysis is an important field of research in modern world. It has wide applications 
in surveillance and public safety which are one of the prime social concerns. One way to analyze 
crowd behavior is obtain crowd movement data and then find out outliers in the individual trajectories 
to infer any abnormal behavior in the crowd.  

INTRODUCTION 
We have implemented a system that takes a set of trajectories obtained from crowd data and detects 
the outliers in that set. A trajectory is a sequence of points (ùë•,ùë¶,ùë°), where x, y are the ground
coordinates of the person at time t. 

METHODOLOGY
We have implemented the Trajectory Outlier Detection algorithm as proposed in [1]. The algorithm 
detects the outliers from a given set of trajectories. There are three phases in this algorithm: 
1. Partition 
2. Detection 
3. Marking 

PARTITION PHASE 
All the trajectories are partitioned into line segments and all the segments are collectively sent
to the detection phase. These line segments are called t-partitions. 
The technique used for partitioning a trajectory in smaller line segments is based on the principle 
of Minimum Description Length [3].  We aim at finding the points in the trajectory where the behavior
of the trajectory changes rapidly. These points are called characteristic points. Then, the trajectory 
is partitioned at every characteristic point found in it and then represented by a set of line 
segments that join two consecutive characteristic points.  
 
THE MINIMUM DESCRIPTION LENGTH PRINCIPLE [3] 
The optimal partitioning of a trajectory should possess two desirable properties: 
preciseness and conciseness. 
Preciseness means that the difference between a trajectory and a set of its trajectory partitions 
should be as small as possible. 
Conciseness means that the number of trajectory partitions should be as small as possible. 
This is called the MDL principle. [3] The cost of MDL consists of two terms L(H) and L(D|H). 
Here, L(H) represents the sum of the length of all trajectory partitions. L(D|H) represents the sum of 
the distance between a trajectory and a set of its trajectory partitions. 
To get the optimal trajectory partitioning we minimize the MDL cost using an approximate algorithm [3]. 
 
DISTANCE MEASURE 
The distance between two t-partitions is defined as weighted mean of the perpendicular distance, 
parallel distance and the angular distance.  

DETECTION PHASE
For each t-partition we find out the set of trajectories that are close to it. 
A trajectory is said to be close to a t-partition if the length of the part of the trajectory similar 
to the t-partition is greater than the t-partition‚Äôs length. Two t-partitions are said to be similar 
if the distance between them is less than a threshold (ùê∑). Now, if the product of a density parameter
and number of trajectories close to a t-partition is less than a given fraction of the total number of 
trajectories, then we say that the t-partition is an outlier. Density parameter for a t-partition is 
the number of t-partitions which are within a distance equal to the standard deviation of all the pairwise
distances between the t-partitions. 

MARKING PHASE 
If the ratio of total lengths of outlying t-partitions in a trajectory to the length of the trajectory 
itself is greater than a given threshold then we say that the trajectory is an outlier.

FUTURE WORK 
Our outlier detector can be integrated with a supervised machine learning system so that it can learn 
the parameters D, p, and F from a labelled data-set. Then the resulting system can be used as a component 
of an anomaly detector or any other more abstract crowd behavior analysis tool.
