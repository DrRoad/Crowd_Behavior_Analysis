1. People Localization [2]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detection and localization of people in the image is the first step to track pedestrians in a 
crowd scene. This can be done by first extracti9ng the foreground from the scene, quantizing it 
and then concatenating other such quantizations obtained from different camera views.
This concatenation is represented as bit-vector of length M. (M is the sum of resolutions of all
the cameras involved). This bit-vector is called Multi-Silhouette Vector (MSV).
Then the shape of people is approximated as rectangles (or half ellipse half rectangle) [4] 
Such approximation is used to construct atoms of a dictionary D ∈ {0, 1}M×N. Each column of the 
dictionary, i.e. each atom, represents the approximated multi-view silhouette observed at a given 
ground plane point. A typical dictionary contains as many columns as the discretized ground plane 
points in the scene.



2. Tracklet Generation [3]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tracklets represent the position of an individual in a given scene at a given point of time. Many 
tracklets can be combined to get the trajectory of the individual for the corresponding time 
interval.


3. Social Affinity Maps [1]
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SAM is a feature descriptor that represents the behavioral signature of neighbouring pedestrians 
in a crowd. Each pedestrian in the crowd can be represented by SAM at a given point of time. SAM 
is essentially a radial histogram representation of the neighborhood of the pedestrian.
It captures the number of tracklets in a small neighborhood of the pedestrian and bins them in 
10 segments, thus constructing the histogram. 
This histogram is then quantized to get a binary vector of 10 components. We use HAMMING DISTANCE 
as the distance measure between two SAM descriptors.
